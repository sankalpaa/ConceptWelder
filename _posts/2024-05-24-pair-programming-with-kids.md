            As a dad, I want to teach my kids the things I learned later in life, hoping they get a head start. One day, I decided to introduce my three kids to the world of programming, starting with HTML because I thought it would be easy. To my surprise, only one of them was interested.

            I am always inspired by watching Dr. Ruchira Wijerathna's  ['Science With Ruchira'](https://www.youtube.com/@ScienceWithRuchira) YouTube channel. One day, I showed my kids his ['DIY Arduino RC Car'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7A0ICf_pa4) video (In Sinhala Language), as they are big fans of vehicles.

                I said, "Yes, you can build it yourselves. I can help." 
                Their next question was, "How can we build such a vehicle ourselves?"
