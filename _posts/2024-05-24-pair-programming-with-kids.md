        As a dad, I want to teach my kids the things I learned later in life, hoping they get a head start. One day, I
        decided to introduce my three kids to the world of programming, starting with HTML because I thought it would be
        easy. To my surprise, only one of them was interested.

        when I was watching a 
        video I found this
        video about a Remote control
        jeep I thout I could play
        with it all day so I startet
        to make it with my brother
        first he told he will show
        how to do it after lots of
        work it looked like this"></a>

        So after that we had all set
        not all because we had to
        programe if we didn'
        programe nothing would happen
        so we programe it was hard
        to programe all the stuff
        because if had a small
        mistake we have to do it
        again so we programe it all
        day so now the hard
        part was over we had
        to put the programe
        it to the Node MCU" width="100%"></a>
